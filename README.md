### Hi there, Spark is great, let's get organized with those huge number of tables, columns, types, constraints, validations! Is the input file coming from upstream has a different schema than we are coding for? What's those differences?

[logic-schema](https://github.com/Spark-DS/logic-schema) can help! ðŸ‘‹
